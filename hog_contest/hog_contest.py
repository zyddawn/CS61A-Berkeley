This is a minimal contest submission file. You may also submit the full
hog.py from Project 1 as your contest entry.

Only this file will be submitted. Make sure to include any helper functions
from `hog.py` that you'll need here! For example, if you have a function to

Don't forget: your strategy must be deterministic and pure.
